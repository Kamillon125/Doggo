Being able to see the effectiveness of moves while picking pokemon, being able to switch them in and out so easily, all those little things made for a really enjoyable experience. \n\nThe story was also pretty alright, although the main issue I have with it is that you always feel like Lillie is the main protagonist and you are basically just her bodyguard. The rival - Hau, while not too great, was miles ahead of gen 6 rivals. I felt like he changed throughout the game, became a better trainer, and I was genuinely proud of his achievements, like when he beat Hala. \n\nI love how easy the game makes XP farming and shiny hunting with the SOS method, I feel like it was a great addition. And while I still do think it is a pretty easy game I also think it is way more challenging than X/Y. \n\nI loved that gyms were replaced with trials. They felt way less grindy and each trial was unique in its own way. I really liked how useful the bottom screen became. The elite 4 was not difficult to beat and neither was the champion, but at least I felt a sense of accomplishment unlike in gen 6. \n\nI know I am comparing this game to gen 6 a lot, but I just think it does a lot of things better. One thing I really did not like, however, was the ungodly amount of cutscenes. Like, WHY? It completely kills the replayability potential of the game and makes the first 5-10 hours feel more like a chore than a fun experience. Some trials were stupidly tedious but I largely enjoyed them.')
