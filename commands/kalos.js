I would not say it is bad per se, but so far it is definitely my least favourite pokemon game. \n\nI think that the main issue I have with it is just how forgettable everything is. I barely remember anything from the story (even though pokemon stories are not really all the games are about), the only area of the game I still remember is coastal Kalos and the evil team may have aswell not existed at all. \n\nReally, though, it was so obvious who the bad guy was from the start. I definitely think the game was very, very easy, partly due to the Exp Share but also because of the trainers AI. \n\nThe champion battle was very underwhelming and I would go as far as to say some gym members were harder to beat. I do love Kalos starters, though. \n\nThe game gives you so many free pokemon you may aswell not catch any and have a nearly full party by the end of your playthrough. oh yea the rivals existed aswell but honestly I do not even remember their names; they were so useless, meaningless and forgettable.');
