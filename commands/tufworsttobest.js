The only good quality was co-op play. \n\nRed/Blue/Yellow - An insane amount of bugs, hasn\'t aged well at all, bad pacing, unbalanced levels \n\nSun and Moon - basically USUM with less features \n\n Gold/Silver/Crystal - Levelling issues and difficulty spikes, no reason to play it over HGSS \n\nDiamond/Pearl - Worst pacing in the series, only 2 catchable fire mon before elite 4, slow movement, no reason to play over Platinum \n\nRuby/Sapphire - no reason to play over ORAS \n\nHGSS - same issues as GSC but less outdated, extended story, new mechanics make it more fun \n\nBlack/White - Added a lot, no old pokemon in the game which kinda sucks, no reason to play over B2W2 \n\nXY - Good postgame, new pokemon are incredible, mega evolution is great, relaxing, pacing and difficulty are atrocious \n\n B2W2 - Very good story, fast battles, weird looking fake 3d - kinda cool but a bit jarring. The best story in all of Pokemon, very good postgame and a lot of new mods. \n\nFR/LG - The best Kanto remake, prety good pacing, relatively challenging, sprites are the best in the series. Fun and relaxing. \n\nORAS - improved Rubby and Sapphire - no battle frontier and worse story than Emerald. Best postgame in all of Pokemon. \n\nUSUM - Passable story, amazing variety of pokemon, great postgame, no HMs, new shiny hunting methods, improved competitive \n\nEmerald - Incredible story, best evil teams in the series, huge variety of pokemon, one of the most open world Pokemon games with great pacing and difficulty. \n\nPlatinum - An amazing all rounder, did almost everything well enough to be acceptable, nothing offensively bad. The evil team is ehh')
