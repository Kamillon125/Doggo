I\'ll get the cons out of the way first and then move on to the reasons as to why I love this game:\n\n-I always felt like I was underlevel, in fact I had to spend roughly 7 hours grinding the elite 4 to beat Cynthia.\n-I hated the fog, the mud and how snow slowed you down. I also didn\'t like that you needed an HM slave. There are\'nt many fire pokemon to catch so Rapidash, Houndoom or Magmortar are your only options, unless, of course, you picked chimchar as your starter.\n\nNow, what do I love about this game? The soundtrack was very good, especially Cynthia\'s battle music and the background music in the Distortion World, which, by itself, was a very unique experience.\n\n I honestly didn\'t really care about the evil team that much, they were just kind of there, I liked Cyrus\' character but everything else about them was mediocre at best.\n\nThe routes genuinely felt like their own locations that I could find many ways to traverse, I did not find them to feel like fillers like in other Pokemon games.\n\nMt. Coronet was okay-ish; can\'t call it my favourite location ever but definitely the most memorable one. It plays a huge role in the story aswell.\n\n Cynthia was **by far** the best pokemon champion in any of the games I\'ve played. She was a true champion - the strongest trainer in the region. She helped you out throughout the game, didn\'t flex on you the first time you met her, just said she\'s a \'trainer\'. Throughout the story it feels like she\'s your friend more than anything else, let alone the champion. Winning against her gave me a huge sense of accomplishment as her team is very, very good.')
